# Telecom Operator Customer Churn Predictor

Welcome to the **Telecom Operator Customer Churn Predictor** repository!  
This project aims to analyze customer data from a telecom operator and predict churn using machine learning techniques. Understanding churn is crucial for telecom businesses to retain customers and improve their services.

## Note
Please keep the Python script and sample data in a single folder, to avoid any error.

## Project Overview

Customer churn prediction helps telecom companies identify customers likely to leave their service. Using data analysis and predictive modeling, this repository provides tools to:

- Clean and preprocess telecom data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train machine learning models to predict churn
- Evaluate model performance
- Visualize key metrics and results

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- EDA with insightful visualizations
- Multiple machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC
- Easy-to-use scripts and notebooks

## Dataset

The dataset includes customer details such as:

- Demographic information
- Service usage patterns
- Billing and payment information
- Churn status

## Model Details

The project uses popular machine learning models such as:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Results

- Visualization of churn rates
- Confusion matrix and classification reports
- ROC curve and feature importance plots
